I HAVE FINALLY CONNECTED IT TO TEH BACKEND OFEDNSOFNDOSHJFOSDJFIOSDF

ADD DATE JOINED INTO THE USER INFO AND REWORK THE REST OF IT BECAUSE I DONT LIKE IT

Due to free website hosting limitations, need to make one big api call instead of all the little ones

Variable to see isSearching because then it would display user's info
Big fetch would need to do 

**userpfp
- username
- datejoined, bio, watchlist
- reviews + ratings and distribute it in the two grid cells
